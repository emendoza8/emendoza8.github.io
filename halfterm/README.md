For my halfterm project, I've made a music visualiser. Dependencies include ThreeJS for graphics, orbit controls, and sound analyzing. Dat.GUI is used to a display that controls bloom and color change post processing effects. I also used a perlin noise function as provided by the library listed below. dat.GUI and some ThreeJS functions are being delivered via CDN so you need a webserver to my project. Once you've got one up and running, run the index.html file located in the root directory and should be good to go. If something has changed with ThreeJS or if it's buggy for any other reason, I'm also hosting here:
